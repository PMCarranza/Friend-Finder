# **Friend-Finder Web Application**

This full-stack app takes the answers to the questions presented to the user, then compares those answers to the values assigned to the "contestants". The app will then display the name and picture of the "contestant" with the best overall match to the user's answers.
In this control enviroment case, the app will match the user with a greek god.
In the future this app could help users connect with others who share their same interests and passions.

## **Installation**
npm packages needed to install and run this app:
•  express
•  path

## **Roadmap**
The next play will be to add an option for the user to add an image of their choice, modify the ui so it is easy on the eyes and after this has been acomplished I think I will look into saving the answers to create a larger pool of participants.

## **Contributing**
I am the only one maintaining this app, and it is not of high priority at the moment.

## **Acknowledgments**
I have created this app following class exercises and research of my own, I have added notes to help my understanding.
I would like to thank Catherine Pham, Ben Vaagen and Arron Linton for the tireless support in the process.
